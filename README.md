#### Abstract

The best neighborhood in Pittsburgh was measured by the best place to own a dog.  With housing availability, dog licenses per zip code, and supermarkets, as individual metrics, each member was able to determine the best neighborhood based on their metric.  Then, a final conclusion was determined by combining the conclusions to find an overall best neighborhood that has both dog friendly housing and resources to own a dog.
